# Artificial Intelligence Intel 

This repository contains various projects and modules focused on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). Each folder in the repository represents different stages and concepts in AI development, using Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, TensorFlow, and Keras, among others. Below is an overview of each folder and its contents:

## 1. Data
This folder covers data manipulation using:
- **pandas**: for handling and analyzing data structures.
- **matplotlib**: for visualizations.
- **numpy**: for numerical operations.
- **OS**: for managing files and directories.

Topics include loading, preprocessing, and visualizing datasets.

## 2. Genetic Algorithm

This section contains a genetic word prediction algorithm. It explores:
- The use of randomness, fuzz, and other genetic algorithm techniques to predict words.
- Applications of evolutionary computing in solving optimization problems.

## 3. Images

Focused on image manipulation, this module includes:
- **pandas** and **numpy**: for handling data.
- **pyplot**: from matplotlib for image visualization.
- **imageio**: for reading and writing images.

The module introduces about basic image transformations and analysis.
